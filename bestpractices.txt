Best practices:

1. lower the fps, by default melonJS output 60 FPS (at least try), 
which is sometimes not really required, you can for example define a 30 FPS rate (or even 25) 
by doing the following (before video.init) :
me.sys.fps = 30;


2. enable requestAnimation Frame instead of the default setInteveral. This is however still a bit buggy and
 depending of what you are doing might trigger some strange behavior .on my side I have games perfectly fine with it, 
 and other for which crazy things are happening : 
 me.sys.useNativeAnimFrame = true;


Note that with the two above points, you might then have to readjust timing in our game (object velocity,...)

3. Optimize your assets, with the following tools, you can easily divide by two the size of your PNG (this might help a bit)

4. Optimize your code : cache reused information, and keep in mind that each time you don't return true 
from an object update function, 
the draw function is not called as well
